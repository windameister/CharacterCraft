"Welcome to our character creation process! We're excited to help you bring your character to life. To get started, we'll need a little bit of information from you.
Please provide some basic details about your character. This can include their name, age, appearance, profession, or any key personality traits. You might also want to think about their background—where they come from, what their family is like, or any significant events in their past.
Remember, these are just the basics. Our system will use your ideas as a starting point and then use its imagination to expand your character's personality, background, and world view. We'll even generate a scenario where the interaction between you and your character happens, and the first greeting message your character would say to you.
Don't worry about getting everything perfect right now. The goal is to give us a starting point to create a rich, detailed character. Feel free to let your imagination run wild and have fun with this process!"
